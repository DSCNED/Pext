class Action(Enum):
    """The list of actions a module can request.

    A module can request any of these actions of the core by putting it in the
    queue. All of these actions need to be accompanied by a list of arguments.

    Example:
        self.q.put([Action.add_message, "message to show"])

    critical_error:
        Show an error message on the screen and unload the module.
        This function is also called when the module throws an exception.

        message -- error message to show

    add_message:
        Show a message on the screen.

        message -- message to show

    add_error:
        Show an error message on the screen.

        message -- error message to show

    add_entry:
        Add an entry to the entry list.

        entry -- the entry

    prepend_entry:

        entry -- the entry

    remove_entry:
        Remove an entry from the entry list.

        Replace the list of entries with the given list.

        list -- the new list of entries

    add_command:
        Add an entry to the command list.

        entry -- the entry

    prepend_command:
        Prepend an entry to the command list.

        entry -- the entry

    remove_command:
        Remove a command from the entry list.

        entry -- the entry

    replace_command_list:
        Replace the list of commands with the given list.

        list -- the new list of entries

    set_header:

        If header is not given, the header will be removed.

        header -- the new header text

    set_filter:
        Replace the text currently in the search bar.

        filter -- the new text to put in the search bar

    ask_question_default_yes:

        question -- the question to ask

        question -- the question to ask

    ask_input:
        Ask the user to input a single line of text.

        text -- the text to show the user, such as "Please enter code"

    ask_input_password:
        Ask the user to input a single line of text into a password field.

        text -- the text to show the user, such as "Please enter code"

    ask_input_multi_line:

    copy_to_clipboard:

        text -- the text to copy to the clipboard

    set_selection:
        Change the internal Pext selected entry for this module.

        The internal Pext selected entry contains an array of the path the
        user has taken in selection and thus looks like follows:
        ["Settings", "Audio", "Mute"].

        To go a single level up, simply remove the last entry from this list.
        To reset to the main screen, use an empty list.

    notify_message:
        Notify the user.

        message -- the message to show

    notify_error:

        Call this when the user is done. For example, when the user made a
        selection.
