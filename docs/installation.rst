Installation
============

Please note that these instructions are for normal installation. If you instead want to help develop, look into `compiling from source <compiling.html>`__.

Windows
-------
A Windows installer is available `in the releases section on GitHub <https://github.com/Pext/Pext/releases>`__.

macOS
-----
A macOS .dmg file is available `in the releases section on GitHub <https://github.com/Pext/Pext/releases>`__.

GNU/Linux
---------

Arch Linux
``````````
Pext is available as `pext <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pext/>`__ and `pext-git <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pext-git/>`__. These packages are maintained by `Agesly Danzig <https://github.com/agesly>`__.

openSUSE
````````

Take a look at the `available repositories <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/TheLastProject:/python-pext/>`__ and pick the one most relevant to you.

As an example, assuming openSUSE Leap 15.1::

  zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/TheLastProject/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/home:thelastproject:python-pext.repo
  zypper install python-Pext

Nightly builds are `also available <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/TheLastProject:/python-pext:/devel/>`__.

Other distros
`````````````
An AppImage is available `in the releases section on GitHub <https://github.com/Pext/Pext/releases>`__. It can be ran in-place on pretty much any GNU/Linux distribution. Make sure to right click the AppImage and mark it as executable in properties. Then, just double click.

Alternatively, you may install Pext through pip::

  pip3 install --user pext

On some systems, you may need to use pip instead of pip3.
